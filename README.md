# architect

*interactive lil install script for arch*

+ fs: btrfs with snapshots
+ shell: zsh
+ editor: nvim with nvchad
+ display server: wayland
+ window manager: hyprland
+ terminal: kitty

uses a custom goofy graphics lib to interactively install arch the way i like it

this is not all-purpose. if ur not me u probly dont want to use this

adds all the other lil goodies like wifi and bluetooth, firefox and discord, standard desktop gui apps like a file manager and stuff, dev stuff like cargo, asdf, docker, it clones my dotfiles and symlinkt them too, its just all around nifty
